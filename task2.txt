Given N candies and K people. In the first turn, the first person gets 1 candy, the second gets 2 candies, and so on till K people. In the next turn, the first person gets K+1 candies, the second person gets k+2 candies, and so on. If the number of candies is less than the required number of candies at every turn, then the person receives the remaining number of candies. 
The task is to find the total number of candies every person has at the end. 
Test Case 1
Input:
    N = 10 (candies)
    K = 3 (people)

Expected Output:
    The candies distribution should be [5, 2, 3].
Test Case 2
Input:
    N = 20 (candies)
    K = 5 (people)

import java.util.Arrays;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  
	    int n=10,k=3;
	    int a[]= new int[k];
	    int i=0,j=0;
	    while(n>0)
	    {
	        
	        j=i+1;
	        if(n>=j){
	        a[i%k]=a[i%k]+j;
	        n=n-j;
	        i++;
	        }
	        
	        else
	        {
	            a[i%k]=a[i%k]+n;
	        n=0;
	        }
	    }
	    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
	}
}
